Adapter

Concepts

 Plug adaptor
 Convert interface into another interface
 Legacy
 Translates requests
 Client, Adapter, Adaptee
 Examples:

 Arrays -> Lists
 Streams

Design

Client centric
Integrate new with old
Interface, but not required
Adaptee can be the implementation

Everyday Example - Arrays.asList

Integer[] arrayOfInts = new Integer[] { 42, 43, 44 };

List<Integer> listOfInts = Arrays.asList(arrayOfInts);

System.out.println(arrayOfInts);

System.out.println(listOfInts);

Exercise Adapter

Walkthrough
Create Adapter
Decorator
Another Adapter

Pitfalls

 Not a lot!
 Don't complicate
 Multiple Adapters
 Don't add functionality

Contrast

Adapter
 Works after code is designed
 Legacy
 Retrofitted
 Provides different interface

Bridge
 Designed upfront
 Abstraction and implementation

vary

 Built in advance
 Both adapt multiple systems

Adapter Summary

 Simple solution
 Easy to implement
 Integrate with Legacy
 Can provide multiple adapters
