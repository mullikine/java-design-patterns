Concepts

 Factory of Factories
 Factory of related objects
 Common Interface
 Defer to Subclasses
 Examples:
 DocumentBuilder
 Frameworks

Design

Groups Factories together
Factory is responsible for lifecycle
Common Interface
Concrete Classes
Parameterized create method
Composition

Everyday Example - DocumentBuilderFactory

DocumentBuilderFactory abstractFactory =
DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstance();

DocumentBuilder factory = abstractFactory.newDocumentBuilder();

Document doc = factory.parse(bais);

Exercise AbstractFactory

Code Walkthrough
AbstractFactory
Factory
Product

Pitfalls

 Complexity
 Runtime switch
 Pattern within a pattern
 Problem specific
 Starts as a Factory

Contrast

Factory
 Returns various instances
 Multiple constructors
 Interface driven
 Adaptable to environment more

easily

AbstractFactory
 Implemented with a Factory
 Hides the Factory
 Abstracts Environment
 Built through Composition
