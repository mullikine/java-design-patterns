Concepts

 Handles complex constructors
 Large number of parameters
 Immutability
 Examples:

 StringBuilder
 DocumentBuilder
 Locale.Builder

Design

Flexibility over telescoping constructors
Static inner class
Calls appropriate constructor
Negates the need for exposed setters
Java 1.5+ can take advantage of Generics

Everyday Example - StringBuilder

StringBuilder builder = new StringBuilder();

builder.append("This is an example ");

builder.append("of the builder pattern. ");

builder.append("It has methods to append ");

builder.append("almost anything we want to a String. ");

builder.append(42);

Exercise Builder

Demonstrate Exposed Setters
Demonstrate Telescoping Constructors
Create Builder
Build Out Example

Pitfalls

 Immutable
 Inner static class
 Designed first
 Complexity
 Method returns object

Contrast

Builder
 Handles complex constructors
 No interface required
 Can be a separate class
 Works with legacy code

Prototype
 Implemented around a clone
 Avoids calling complex

code

constructors

 Difficult to implement in legacy

Builder Summary

 Creative way to deal with complexity
 Easy to implement
 Few drawbacks
 Can refactor in with separate class
