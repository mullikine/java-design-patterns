Concepts

 Localize state behavior
 State Object
 Separates What from Where
 OCP
 Examples:
 None!
 JSF
 Iterator

Design

Abstract Class / Interface
Class based
Context unaware
Context, State, ConcreteState

UML

Everyday Example - if/else

final static int ON = 0;
final static int OFF = 1;
int state = OFF;

public void pullChain() {

if(state == ON) {

System.out.println("Fan is already on");

}
else if (state == OFF) {

System.out.println("Turning Fan on.");
state = ON;

}

}

Exercise State

State
ConcreteState
Conditional Logic

Pitfalls

 Know your States
 More classes
 Keep logic out of Context
 State change triggers

Contrast

State
 Interface based
 Transitions
 Class per State

Strategy
 Interface based
 Algorithms are Independent
 Class per Algorithm

State Summary

 Simplifies cyclomatic complexity
 Adding additional states made easier
 More classes
 Similar implementation to Strategy
